    <!-- My Story -->
    <section class="story">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-title">My Story</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p class="story-opening">I didn't arrive at this work by accident.</p>
                
                <p>A few years ago, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease — an experience that deeply changed my relationship with my body. There were days when inflammation, fatigue, and pain made even basic movement feel impossible. Living with that level of uncertainty taught me firsthand how isolating and overwhelming chronic illness can be.</p>
                
                <p>While medication was part of my journey, I felt called to understand why my body was responding the way it was. I began focusing on the same fundamentals I now use at Royal Phoenix Health & Wellness: nervous system regulation, stress and emotional awareness, energetic balance, and addressing root causes rather than symptoms alone.</p>
                
                <p>With time, patience, and compassion, my body began to heal. Under appropriate guidance, I was able to come off medication — and today, I am in remission.</p>
                
                <div class="story-insight">
                    <p>That journey taught me something powerful:</p>
                    <p class="story-insight-text">The body is not broken. It is adaptive, intelligent, and always communicating.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Royal Phoenix was born from that lived experience. I don't just guide others through healing — I understand it from the inside out. I know what it's like to struggle, to grieve your old sense of normal, and to rebuild trust with your body one step at a time.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="story-quote">
                    "I believe healing is possible — even when it feels unreachable — because I've lived it."
